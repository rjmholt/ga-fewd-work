    <hr>
    <h3><a id="Description_5"></a>Description</h3>
    <p>The team from CitiPix has reached out for iteration on their prototype. Instead of using a user’s text input to change the background of the interface, the CitiPix user experience designers have asked to see how a drop-down menu would work in place of an input field. </p>
    <p>The product managers are hopeful it will also lead to less error handling for their engineers and data team. </p>
    <p>Use what you’ve learned this week about data-types and arrays and use the starter code - or your code from last week - and make the adjustments to your JavaScript file. Be sure to start out with Pseudocode.</p>

    <h3><a id="RealWorld_Applications_14"></a>Real-World Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use data stored in an array to manipulate the DOM</li>
        <li>Write pseudocode before writing any JavaScript, in order to demonstrate an understanding of interactive programming theory</li>
        <li>Revisit applications and code you’ve written in the past to find solutions to problems you’ve already solved and iterate on a project</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a id="Technical_Requirements_26"></a>Technical Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an array with the following values: “NYC”, “SF”, “LA”, “ATX”, “SYD”; use the array to add values to the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menu by using a <code>for</code> loop in JavaScript (don’t update the HTML to do this!)</li>
        <li>When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected</li>
        <li>Use $.append() in your iteration on the drop-down menu</li>
        <li>Use the <code>$.attr()</code> function to update html classes</li>
        <li>Get the value of user input using <code>$.val()</code></li>
        <li>Use the <code>$.change</code> event handler to capture user actions</li>
        <li>Use <code>if/else if/else</code> conditionals to control the flow of your application</li>
        <li>Display your pseudocode as Javascript comments</li>
    </ul>

        <li><a href="http://bavotasan.com/2011/style-select-box-using-only-css/">Read</a> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/dropdown-default-styling/">up</a> on your own and incorporate some more styles on the drop down menu</li>
        <li>While the dropdown menu should update the page in the same way it did after your work last week, take a look at what your final product should look like with a dropdown menu:</li>

    <h3><a id="Evaluation__Submission_68"></a>Evaluation / Submission</h3>
    <p>Students should use the same folder and GitHub repository as the previous project (“homework-city”). When ready for evaluation they should push their code to that repository. Instructional team should evaluate against the solution code and the student’s use of technical elements. They will provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2). The maximum possible score on this assignment is 16/16. Bonus materials are completely optional.</p>
